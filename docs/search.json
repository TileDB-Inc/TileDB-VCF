    "text": "Unlike TileDB-VCF’s CLI, which exports directly to disk, results for queries performed using Python are read into memory. Therefore, when querying even moderately sized genomic datasets, the amount of available memory must be taken into consideration.\nThis guide demonstrates several of the TileDB-VCF features for overcoming memory limitations when querying large datasets. \n\n\nOne strategy for accommodating large queries is to simply increase the amount of memory available to tiledbvcf. By default tiledbvcf allocates 2GB of memory for queries. However, this value can be adjusted using the memory_budget_mb parameter. For the purposes of this tutorial the budget will be decreased to demonstrate how tiledbvcf is able to perform genome-scale queries even in a memory constrained environment.\nimport tiledbvcf\ncfg = tiledbvcf.ReadConfig(memory_budget_mb=256)\nds = tiledbvcf.Dataset(uri, mode = \"r\", cfg = cfg)\n\n\n\nFor queries that encompass many genomic regions you can simply provide an external bed file. In this example, you will query for any variants located in the promoter region of a known gene located on chromosomes 1-4.\nAfter performing a query, you can use read_completed() to verify whether or not all results were successfully returned.\nattrs = [\"sample_name\", \"contig\", \"pos_start\", \"fmt_GT\"]\ndf = ds.read(attrs, bed_file = \"data/gene-promoters-hg38.bed\")\nds.read_completed()\n\n## False\nIn this case, it returned False, indicating the requested data was too large to fit into the allocated memory so tiledbvcf retrieved as many records as possible in this first batch. The remaining records can be retrieved using continue_read(). Here, we’ve setup our code to accommodate the possibility that the full set of results are split across multiple batches.\nprint (\"The dataframe contains\")\n\nwhile not ds.read_completed():\n    print (f\"\\t...{df.shape[0]} rows\")\n    df = df.append(ds.continue_read())\n\nprint (f\"\\t...{df.shape[0]} rows\")\n\n## The dataframe contains\n##   ...1525201 rows\n##   ...3050402 rows\n##   ...3808687 rows\nHere is the final dataframe, which includes 3,808,687 records:\ndf\n\n##         sample_name contig  pos_start    fmt_GT\n## 0       v2-Qhhvcspe   chr1          1  [-1, -1]\n## 1       v2-YMaDHIoW   chr1          1  [-1, -1]\n## 2       v2-Mcwmkqnx   chr1          1  [-1, -1]\n## 3       v2-RzweTRSv   chr1          1  [-1, -1]\n## 4       v2-ijrKdkKh   chr1          1  [-1, -1]\n## ...             ...    ...        ...       ...\n## 758280  v2-PDeVyHSO   chr4  190063262    [0, 0]\n## 758281  v2-PDeVyHSO   chr4  190063264  [-1, -1]\n## 758282  v2-PDeVyHSO   chr4  190063265  [-1, -1]\n## 758283  v2-PDeVyHSO   chr4  190063392    [0, 0]\n## 758284  v2-PDeVyHSO   chr4  190063418  [-1, -1]\n## \n## [3808687 rows x 4 columns]\n\n\n\nA Python generator version of the read method is also provided.

    "text": "TileDB Embedded provides native support for reading from and writing to cloud object stores like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Store. This guide will cover some considerations for using TileDB-VCF with these services. The examples will focus exclusively on S3, which is the most widely used, but note any of the aforementioned services can be substituted, as well as on-premise services like MinIO that provide S3-compatible APIs.\n\n\nThe process of creating a TileDB-VCF dataset on S3 is nearly identical to creating a local dataset. The only difference being an s3:// address is passed to the --uri argument rather than a local file path.\ntiledbvcf create --uri s3://my-bucket/my_dataset\nThis also works when querying a TileDB-VCF dataset located on S3.\ntiledbvcf export \\\n  --uri s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/tiledbvcf-arrays/v4/vcf-samples-20 \\\n  --sample-names v2-tJjMfKyL,v2-eBAdKwID \\\n  -Ot --tsv-fields \"CHR,POS,REF,S:GT\" \\\n  --regions \"chr7:144000320-144008793,chr11:56490349-56491395\"\n\n\n\nVCF files located on S3 can be ingested directly into a TileDBVCF dataset using 1 of 2 different possible approaches. \n\n\nThe first approach is the easiest, you simply pass the tiledbvcf store command a list of S3 URIs and TileDB-VCF takes care of the rest:\ntiledbvcf store \\\n    --uri my_dataset \\\n    s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G4.bcf\nIn this approach, remote VCF index files (which are relatively tiny) are downloaded locally, allowing TileDB-VCF to retrieve chunks of variant data from the remote VCF files without having to download them in full. By default, index files are downloaded to your current working directory, however, you can choose to store them in different location (e.g., a temporary directory) using the --scratch-dir argument.\n\n\n\nThe second approach is to download batches of VCF files in their entirety before ingestion, which may slightly improve ingestion performance. This approach requires allocating TileDB-VCF with scratch disk space using the --scratch-mb and --scratch-dir arguments.\ntiledbvcf store \\\n    --uri my_dataset \\\n    --scratch-dir \"$TMPDIR\" \\\n    --scratch-mb 4096 \\\n    s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G4.bcf\nThe number of VCF files that are downloaded at a time is determined by the --sample-batch-size parameter, which defaults to 10. Downloading and ingestion happens asynchronously, so, for example, batch 3 will be downloaded as batch 2 is being ingestion. As a result, you must configure enough scratch space to store at least 20 samples, assuming a batch size of 10.\n\n\n\n\nFor TileDB to access a remote storage bucket you must be properly authenticated on the machine running TileDB. For S3, this means having access to the appropriate AWS access key ID and secret access key. This typically happens in one of three ways:\n\n\nIf the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is installed on your machine, running aws configure will store your credentials in a local profile that TileDB can access. You can verify the CLI has been previously configured by running:\naws s3 ls\nIf properly configured, this will output a list of the S3 buckets you (and thus TileDB) can access.\n\n\n\nYou can pass your AWS access key ID and secret access key to TileDB-VCF directly via the --tiledb-config argument, which expects a comma-separated string:\ntiledbvcf store \\\n    --uri my_dataset \\\n    --tiledb-config vfs.s3.aws_access_key_id=<id>,vfs.s3.aws_secret_access_key=<secret> \\\n    s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G4.bcf\n\n\n\nYour AWS credentials can also be passed to TileDB by defining the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables."

    "text": "TileDB-VCF’s Spark API offers a DataSourceV2 data source to read TileDB-VCF datasets into a Spark dataframe. To begin, launch a Spark shell with:\nspark-shell \\\n    --jars build/libs/TileDB-VCF-Spark-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\nDepending on the size of the dataset and query results, you may need to increase the configured memory from the defaults.:\nspark-shell \\\n    --jars build/libs/TileDB-VCF-Spark-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\n    --driver-memory 16g \\\n    --executor-memory 16g\nWhile the Spark API offers much of the same functionality provided by the CLI, the main considerations when using the Spark API are typically dataframe partitioning and memory overhead.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to partition a TileDB-VCF dataframe, which can be used separately or together:\n\nPartitioning over samples (.option(\"sample_partitions\", N)).\nPartitioning over genomic regions (.option(\"range_partitions\", M)).\n\nConceptually, these correspond to partitioning over rows and columns, respectively, in the underlying TileDB array. For example, if you are reading a subset of 200 samples in a dataset, and specify 10 sample partitions, Spark will create 10 jobs, each of which will be responsible for handling the export from 20 of the 200 selected samples.\nSimilarly, if the provided BED file contains 1,000,000 regions, and you specify 10 region partitions, Spark will create 10 jobs, each of which will be responsible for handling the export of 100,000 of the 1,000,000 regions (across all samples).\nThese two partitioning parameters can be composed to form rectangular regions of work to distribute across the available Spark executors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nThe CLI interface offers the same partitioning feature, using the --sample-partition and --region-partition flags. \n\n\n\n\n\nBecause TileDB-VCF is implemented as a native library, the Spark API makes use of both JVM on-heap and off-heap memory. This can make it challenging to correctly tune the memory consumption of each Spark job.\nThe .option(\"memory\", mb) option is used as a best-effort memory budget that any particular job is allowed to consume, across on-heap and off-heap allocations. Increasing the available memory with this option can result in large performance improvements, provided the executors are configured with sufficient memory to avoid OOM failures.\n\n\n\nTo export a few genomic regions from a dataset (which must be accessible by the Spark jobs; here we assume it is located on S3):\nval df = spark.read.format(\"io.tiledb.vcf\")\\\n        .option(\"uri\", \"s3://my-bucket/my-dataset\")\\\n        .option(\"ranges\", \"chr1:1000-2000,chr2:500-501\")\\\n        .option(\"samples\", \"sampleA,sampleB,sampleD\")\\\n        .option(\"range_partitions\", 2).load()\n\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"vcf\")\n\nspark.sql(\"select contig, posStart, alleles, genotype from vcf\").show\nBecause there are only two regions specified, and two region partitions, each of the two Spark jobs started will read one of the given regions.\nWe can also place a list of sample names and a list of genomic regions to read in explicit text files, and use those during reading:\nval df = spark.read.format(\"io.tiledb.vcf\")\\\n        .option(\"uri\", \"s3://my-bucket/my-dataset\")\\\n        .option(\"bedfile\", \"s3://my-bucket/query.bed\")\\\n        .option(\"samplefile\", \"s3://my-bucket/sample-names.txt\")\\\n        .option(\"memory\", 8*1024)\\\n        .option(\"sample_partitions\", 10)\\\n        .option(\"range_partitions\", 2).load()\n\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"vcf\")\n\nspark.sql(\"select contig, posStart, alleles, genotype from vcf\").show\nHere, we’ve also increased the memory budget to 8GB, and added partitioning over samples."

The map_dask() function takes an additional parameter, fnc, allowing you to provide a filtering function that is applied immediately after performing the read but before inserting the result of the partition into the Dask dataframe.\nIn the following example, any variants overlapping regions in very-large-bedfile.bed are filtered out if their start position overlaps the first 25kb of the chromosome.\nimport tiledbvcf\n\nds = tiledbvcf.TileDBVCFDataset('my-large-dataset', mode='r')\ndask_df = ds.map_dask(lambda df: df[df.pos_start < 25000],\n                      attrs=['sample_name', 'pos_start', 'pos_end'],\n                      bed_file='very-large-bedfile.bed',\n                      region_partitions=10,\n                      sample_partitions=2)\nThis approach can be more efficient than using read_dask() with a separate filtering step because it avoids the possibility that partitions require multiple read operations due to memory constraints. \nThe pseudocode describing the read_partition() algorithm (i.e., the code responsible for reading the partition on a Dask worker) is:\nds = tiledbvcf.Dataset(uri, mode='r')\noverall_df = ds.read(attrs, samples, regions, ...)\nwhile not ds.read_completed():\n    df = ds.continue_read()\n    overall_df = overall_df.append(df)\nWhen using map_dask() instead, the pseudocode becomes:\nds = tiledbvcf.Dataset(uri, mode='r')\noverall_df = filter_fnc(ds.read(attrs, samples, regions, ...))\nwhile not ds.read_completed():\n    df = filter_fnc(ds.continue_read())\n    overall_df = overall_df.append(df)\nYou can see that if the provided filter_fnc() reduces the size of the data substantially, using map_dask() can reduce the likelihood that the Dask workers will run out of memory and avoid needing to perform multiple reads."

Next we’ll look at the more common scenario of working with files stored on a cloud object store.\n\n\nIngest from S3\nTileDB Embedded’s native cloud features make it possible to ingest samples directly from remote locations. Here, we’ll ingest the following samples located on AWS S3:\ncat data/s3-bcf-samples.txt\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G4.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G5.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G6.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G7.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G8.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G9.bcf\n## s3://tiledb-inc-demo-data/examples/notebooks/vcfs/G10.bcf\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nSamples in this second batch are stored as BCF files which are also supported by TileDB-VCF.\n\n\nThis process is identical to the steps perfo_r_med above, the only changes needed to our code involve setting --scratch-mb to allocate some temporary space for downloading the files and providing the URLs for the remote files. In this case, we’ll simply pass the s3-bcf-samples.txt file, which includes a list of the BCF files we want to ingest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nWhen ingesting samples from S3, you must configure enough scratch space to hold at least 20 samples. In general, you need 2 × the sample dimension’s sample_bactch_size (which by default is 10). You can read more about the data model here.\n\n\nYou can add the --verbose flag to print out more information during the store phase.\ntiledbvcf store \\\n  --uri small_dataset \\\n  --samples-file data/s3-bcf-samples.txt \\\n  --verbose\n  \n## Initialization completed in 3.17565 sec.\n## ...\n## Done.

    "text": "Population variant data can be efficiently represented using a 3D sparse array. For each sample, imagine a 2D plane where the vertical axis is the contig and the horizontal axis is the genomic position. Every variant can be represented as a range within this plane; it can be unary (i.e., a SNP) or it can be a longer range (e.g., INDEL or CNV). Each sample is then indexed by a third dimension, which is unbounded to accommodate populations of any size. The figure below shows an example for one sample, with several variants distributed across contigs chr1 , chr2 and chr3.\n\n\n\n3D array representation of population variants\n\n\nIn TileDB-VCF, we represent the start position of each range as a non-empty cell in a sparse array (black squares in the above figure). In each of those array cells, we store the end position of each cell (to create a range) along with all other fields in the corresponding single-sample VCF files for each variant (e.g., REF, ALT, etc.). Therefore, for every sample, we map variants to 2D non-empty sparse array cells.\nTo facilitate rapid retrieval of interval intersections (explained in the next section), we also inject anchors (green square in the above figure) to breakup long ranges. Specifically, we create a new non-empty cell every anchor_gap bases from the start of the range (where anchor_gap is a user-defined parameter), which is identical to the range cell, except that (1) it has a new start coordinate and (2) it stores the real start position in an attribute.\nNote that regardless of the number of samples, we do not inject any additional information other than that of the anchors, which is user configurable and turns out to be negligible for real datasets. In other words, this solution leads to linear storage in the number of samples, thus being scalable.\n\n\n\nThe typical access pattern used for variant data involves one or more rectangles covering a set of genomic ranges across one or more samples. In the figure below, let the black rectangle be the user’s query. Observe that the results are highlighted in blue (v1, v2, v4, v7). However, the rectangle misses v1, i.e., the case where an Indel/CNV range intersects the query rectangle, but the start position is outside the rectangle.\n\n\n\nInterval intersection using expanded query ranges and anchors\n\n\nThis is the motivation behind anchors. TileDB-VCF expands the user’s query range on the left by anchor_gap. It then reports as results the cells that are included in the expanded query if their end position (stored in an attribute) comes after the query range start endpoint. In the example above, TileDB-VCF retrieves anchor a1 and Indel/CNV v3. It reports v1 as a result (as it can be extracted directly from anchor a1), but filters out v3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nBy representing each sample’s variants as non-empty cells in a 2D plane and using anchors and expanded queries, we managed to model population variants as 3D sparse arrays and use the vanilla functionality of TileDB-Embedded, inheriting all its powerful features out of the box.\n\n\nQuite often, the analyses requires data retrieval based on numerous query ranges (up to the order of millions), which must be submitted simultaneously. TileDB-VCF leverages the highly optimized multi-range subarray functionality of TileDB Embedded, which leads to unparalleled performance for such scenarios.\nBut what about updates? That’s the topic of the next section.\n\n\n\nTileDB-VCF is based on TileDB Embedded which supports rapid updates via immutable fragments. That means that every time a new batch of samples is added to the 3D array, the previous contents of the array are not modified at all. Each batch write operation is totally independent and _lock-free—_any number of threads or processes can write simultaneously without synchronization, while ensuring consistency. With TileDB-VCF, both update time and storage size scales linearly with the number of new samples, solving the N+1 problem.\n\n\n\nTileDB-VCF allows you to efficiently store, update and access enormous population genomic datasets, all open-source. And although it is a C++ embedded library (which works on a single machine), it also integrates very well with Spark and Dask, enabling you to scale your analysis to large clusters. However, the burden of managing clusters (spinning them up, deploying the software, monitoring the resources, etc.), falls entirely on you, which is quite an undertaking.\nEnter TileDB Cloud!\nTileDB Cloud allows you to perform parallel ingestion and parallel slicing / processing, 100% serverless. This means that you do not have to spin up large clusters or pay for idle time. You can easily slice data or define complex task flows comprised of thousands of tasks, which TileDB Cloud deploys elastically in its serverless infrastructure, providing an unmatched combination of ease of use and low cost on the cloud—even for your most challenging analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nThe shear volume of data generated by modern population genomics applications creates enormous challenges around data management and collaboration.\n\n\nTileDB Cloud offers groundbreaking features for collaborative genomic research:\n\nPopular public datasets made available in the TileDB format for direct analysis\nEasy mechanism for one to share their data and code (Jupyter notebooks and user-defined functions), either with a specific set of users or the entire world\nEasy ways to explore and discover public data and code.\n\nJoin our vision to build a growing community around open data and code!\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with the TileDB Embedded data model, you can delve into the technical details of how TileDB-VCF stores genomic variant data using [D sparse arrays. Otherwise you can proceed with installation instructions and tutorials."
